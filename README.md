# Duly Noted: Annotation-finding strategies for Java

- [x] Direct presence, direct-or-indirect presence, presence, associated
  - [x] On non-classes and classes
- [x] find-one by type, find-all by type, all: as appropriate for above
- [*********] Meta-presence: either <presence-level> on an element, or
  recursively <presence-level> on one of the annotations that are
  <presence-level> on the element

- [ ] Annotation structure, breadth-first
- [ ] Class nesting
  - [ ] Include local and anonymous class possibilities for enclosing
    structures to find annotations on
- [ ] Class hierarchy, depth-first, no repeats
- [ ] Merging operations on a search path

- [ ] Find annotation directly meta-present on an annotated element
    or any enclosing class/package
